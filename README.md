## Day-67---Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-for-dimensionality-reduction
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction. It transforms a dataset with many features (dimensions) into a smaller set of features while preserving as much variance (information) as possible. PCA achieves this by finding new, uncorrelated variables called **principal components**.

These principal components are linear combinations of the original variables, and they are ordered so that the first principal component captures the most variance, the second the next most variance, and so on.

### Why Use PCA?

**Reduce Dimensionality:** Minimize the number of features while retaining the core patterns and variance in the data.

**Speed Up Computation:** Smaller datasets lead to faster model training and inference.

**Avoid Multicollinearity:** By creating uncorrelated components, PCA helps to address multicollinearity issues.

**Visualization:** Reduce high-dimensional data (e.g., 100 features) to 2D or 3D for easier visualization.

### PCA Workflow in Python

**Standardize the Data:** PCA is sensitive to the scale of data. Standardizing ensures all features contribute equally.

**Compute Covariance Matrix:** Calculate the relationships between features.

**Find Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:** Eigenvectors define the principal components, and eigenvalues indicate the variance captured by each component.

**Select Top Components:** Choose the principal components that explain the majority of the variance.

**Transform the Data:** Project the original data onto the selected principal components.
